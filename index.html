2021 was the third year of quarantine, and steam it was good year for steam, players spent 
almost 38 billion hours playing.Twitch also had a good year, averaging 2.78 million concurrent
viewers. My question is "Which game was most popular in 2021 based on average steam players and 
twitch viewers,is the most popular game a first person shooter, if so, should they make a sequel 
to that game?". 
<br><br>
I got my data sources from kaggle, steam player data was the one I used the average player data for games in 2021, the data is credibility after cross checking it with multiple data sources I found on google, the only downside I found with this dataset is that the gamenames's duplicate for each month. I used a linegraph because i'm trying to find the game with most average players over 2021 and a linegraph "tracks changes over short and long periods of time". Top games on Twitch 2016 - 2021 is dataset I used for twitch average viewers and its credible(cross checked with other sites) but the reliability is terrible, it took forever to get pandas to read it as an csv, but other than that it's not bad. I made a piechart and bargraph, the piechart was so I could see the simple numbers of my data and get the gist of the average views. I made the barchart to make the data look cleaner and represent it using categorical data. 
<br><br>
Im finding the average twitch views and average steam player's on each game, both of the average's tend to stay constent with each other but the average steam players are always larger than the viewers on twitch. I decided to find the range bewteen average twitch viewers and average steam players to double check my data and I found that CS:GO(Counter Strike: Global Offensive) had the highest difference with a range of 420,000.
<br><br>
Now that we know that CS:GO had the highest average of steam players and twitch viewers, should they make a sequel? The answer is yes, many fans of CS:GO are waiting for a sequel. You could make an arguement that their average players declined, but that was because they were migrating to Apex legends due to the increasing popularity and player/viewer base. Their are even Reddit pages that are still talking about the possibility of a new CS:GO, so video game studio's should only make sequels after checking the average steam players and average twitch viewers.</p> </p2></p3></div>
